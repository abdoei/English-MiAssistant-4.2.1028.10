# English Translation for MI Phone Assistant
This is a translation of the MI Phone Assistant (小米手机助手) software from Chinese to English. I used Google Translate to translate the strings and then manually corrected the translations. The translation is not perfect, but it should be good enough to understand the software.

## Issue 
The software is in Chinese and there is no option to change the language to English [At least for my new Xiaomi Note 8]. This makes it difficult for non-Chinese speakers like me to use the software. See the release notes [here](https://new.c.mi.com/global/post/973181).

## Tools Used
- Google Translate
- Microsoft Copilot

## How to use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the MI Phone Assistant software on your computer [the installer of the official Chinese app can be found in the release on this repository].
3. Replace the `mi_phone_assistant.res` folder in the installation directory with the `mi_phone_assistant.res` folder from this repository. This could be found in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\MiPhoneAssistant` directory.
4. You can now use the software in English.
